** Applied Example

We found the radius of the earth (at the equator) in a previous example.  If this
class took place on the equator, how many miles would we rotate through over the course
of the class? (Assume I can plan well, and class takes 75 minutes).

The area of a sector with central angle \(\theta\) of a circle of radius \(r\) is:

** Linear vs angular speed

If a wheel is spinning without slipping, one thing we might be interested in is its
*angular speed*.  This is a measure of how quickly the wheel is spinning.  Your car
measures angular speed in revolutions per minute.  We'll usually use _\hspace*{1in}_.

When we use radians per second to measure how fast a wheel is
spinning, it's a fun fact that you can calculate linear speed if you
know angular speed.  We'll denote angular speed with _\hspace*{1in}_
and linear speed with _\hspace*{1in}_.  If the wheel has radius \(r\), then
these two speeds are related by:

\[ v = \hspace{1in}\]

** Example
We know the radius of the earth at the equator and that Earth spins 1
time in 24 hours. Use these facts to calculate how fast (linear speed) someone
standing on the equator of the earth is going just by standing still!
