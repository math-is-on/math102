** Applications of Parabolas
A car's headlights are shaped as parabolic reflectors with the actual light at the focus of the parabola.

1. Why do you think this is the case?


\vspace{10in}

** Example

A car manufacturer wants to make the headlights of a car such that the
actual light for the headlight is at a distance of 4 inches from the
reflector.  What is the equation of the parabola that models this
headlight, assuming the vertex of the parabola is at the origin?

** Example

** Example
A satellite dish is shaped like a paraboloid of revolution. This means
that it can be formed by rotating a parabola around its axis of
symmetry. The receiver is to be located at the focus. If the dish is
12 feet across at its opening and 4 feet deep at its center, where
should the receiver be placed?

** Example

** Example
One more application of parabolas is projectile motion.  If we throw
an object straight into the air with an initial velocity of \(v_0\)
feet per second and from a height of \(h\) feet above ground level, it
can be shown using physics that the equation that tells you the height
of the object (in feet) after \(t\) seconds is

\[s(t) = -16t^2 + v_0 t + h\]

** Example
You throw a ball straight into the air (from the ground) with an
initial velocity of 80 feet per second.  What is the maximum height
that the ball attains?
